# Project JaVelo: A Cycling Route Planner for Switzerland

JaVelo is a Java application designed to plan cycling routes in Switzerland.

JaVelo's interface resembles that of online planners like Google Maps. However, JaVelo is not a web application — it does not partly run in the browser and partly on a remote server — but rather a Java application that runs exclusively on the user's computer.
